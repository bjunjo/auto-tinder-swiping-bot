# auto-tinder-swiping-bot
## Problem: It's tedious to swipe right on Tinder so let Python do it for you.
## Solutions:
1. Using Selenium and Python Navigate to the Tinder website (https://tinder.com/) 
2. Click on LOG IN then LOGIN WITH FACEBOOK.
3. Tinder free tier only allows 100 "Likes" per day. So make a loop for 100 iterations.
4. Use the error handlings correctly (e.g. NoSuchElementException, ElementClickInterceptedException, etc).
